## Attention
Run in linux or WSL because a lot of the filenames of ledgers have : in it which is not allowed on Windows!



To generate graphs you first have to clone the [tab-data](https://github.com/0x20/tab-data) repository into this one. It uses python notebooks at this time but later I want to look at periodically running github actions in the tab-data repo to generate figures automatically and post them somewhere.
